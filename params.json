Adam Designs is a company where you can have your site designed and hosted by an amateur coder like myself. It can take up to three weeks to code some projects and I start at just €5 an hour with the price going down to €2.50 an after 10 hours. I have looked at other sites and the cheapest I have seen that will __build__ a site is €409.44 for a whole project. The very most that I can and will charge is €100 for 30 hours plus. ",
